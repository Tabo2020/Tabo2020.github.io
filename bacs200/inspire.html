        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to.
        Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The characteristics I most admire about Elizabeth Stanton are in the following list:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feminist - Faught to increase legal rights for women and motivated women to vote and have a say in their marriage and politics</li>
        <li>Stronge willed - She is very determine and express that by forming mutiple organizations for equal rights that inculded both women and POC.</li>
        <li>Big footprint - Till this day a lot of women like myself look up to her and are affected by whats shes done for the women right movement.</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & commitment - Becasue she was out spoken, people thought of her as aggressive or alienists.</li>
        <li>Integrity - She was born into an affulenct family and used that power to do good in the world; She not only an activist for women but for the abolishment of slavery aswell.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Although Elizabeth may have enemies through out her life as being a leader of the women right movement 
        she kept her determinations until she died in 1902. It was through her that women were able to vote and have a stance in their 
        marriage, life, and the way they wanted to behave.
