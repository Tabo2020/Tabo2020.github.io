        <h3 class="display-4 font-weight-light text-left bg-link p-3">Economic Implication</h3>
        <p class="text left">
            Climate change has casued many economic impact we are currently experiencing.
        <ul> for example:
            <li>The cost of rebuilding infrastructure. It cost Texas an esitmated of 125 billion dolloar loss due to the Hurrican Harvey created by golbal warming. The cost of damage will hugly impact the economy of the people there because they are not able to produce their product but they still hav eto account for the damages. There are more mix cold and hot air causing more pressure and precipitation in the air equal massive storms. </li>
            <li>The main contributor of earth warming is caused by the greenhouse gas pollution stuck in our atmosphere and its not able to be release back to into space. That will cause ice caps to melt and increase the ocean water level. This will lead to a decrease in crops and a decrease in livestock due to heavy rains. The whole supply chain will be slowed down and there will not be enough resources to put out to the market causing beef and other crops product to increase in price. Our economic system will be slowed down and This may lead to famine.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class:"display-4 Font-weight-light text-left bg-link p-3">Social Implication</h3>
        <p class="text left">

            Some of the social impact indicate that there will be an increase of climate refugee and not enough space to live on land since the sea level is rising.
        <ul>
            <li>This is just a small example but as we seen in the last few months in colorado has been on fire and the fires are lasting longer than it shoud which is harming the animals and communities up in the Cameron peak area. They now have to evacaute their homes and town. The wild life in that area are not able to forage for food and may decrease their number eventually leading to an extinction. That disrupts the whole Rocky Mountain ecosystem. ALot of those communites will now have to move.
            </li>
            <li> In the colorado high mountain tops, there were always snowpack but in recent decades, the snow pack melted away leaving no water for the animals that depend on it. For colorado specifically, we receive about 70% of fresh water from the snowpack and this will cause more problem for us in the future becasue they will contribute to future water scarcity. Since the mountian tops are melting at a faster pace this will casue land erosion that harms biodiverities and extented summer droughts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="display-4 font-weight-light text-left bg-link p-3">Political Implication</h3>
        <p class="text-left">

            Right now we have to presidential election coming up and the topic of climate change has been discussed in the recent debate. There has been a lot of buzz surronding the New Green Deal.
        <ul>
            <li> The New Green Deal and what it entails:
                The main goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emission and to avoid the worse that yet to come from climate change. It also states the socail justic resolution and how that will also go into effect. Federal scientists has warn countries that if we continue to down grade the global temperture rising then that will casue more wild fires, drought and heat waves. Not only will it affect is economically, it iwll also cost us billions of dollars and we can see the effect of it in the southern states close to the oceans. </li>
            <li>to achieve the goals above, the plan states that the govermnet will launch a 10 year mobilization to reduce carbon emission by replacing the US energy source of fossil fuel to renewbale and zero emission power. Since livestock are the biggest contributor to greenhouse emssion, the new green deal did not inculde what they will do with that resources. As much as i am for the new green deal, it does seem a bit impossible considering each components of our world. Such as the amount of time to fully be emission free seems far fetch. The cons of this new green deal does not consider the people who depend on these factories job to support their family. It seems like a great idea on paper but to implement it seems impossible.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4 class="display-4 font-weight-light text-left bg-link p-3">Conclusion</h4>

        <p class="text-center">
            Lastly, we should all be awear of this situation of Gobal warming becasue it going to affect us all right now or in the future. To make sure that there are change made so that our offspring will be safe, its better for us to speak out and vote during this presidential election. The catastrophe in the future will be even worse and yes it seems impossible as of right now but i do feel like there is hope. the econmic impact will affect us since we are going into the work force and in the future we will also see a lot more climate change refugees. To lower the risk we as the new generation should speak up and help lower carbon emission.</p>
